### A few goals of this repository:
 - [ ] Get the front end webpage completed
 - [ ] Blog about the various developmental choices made
 - [ ] Develop a kubernetes pod that will deploy a DMSS configuration
 - [ ] Look fucking cool doing it all
 

### Below are links the to various Git repositories that have helped me along the way.
